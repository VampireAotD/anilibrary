        <p>
            For many years now, Japanese animation has enjoyed great success around the
            world. These titles are loved for their vivid plot, original drawing and
            constant intensity of emotions.

            Many fans love to <strong>watch anime online</strong> and
            <strong>add them to their lists</strong>, but this often requires using
            multiple sources because none of them cannot be called universal. But we have
            great news for anime lovers! We have launched a new project,
            <strong>Anilibrary</strong>, dedicated to scrape data of anime. Now you don’t
            have to surf the Internet in search of your favorite title - all the best
            anime with links to watch are already on our portal. We ourselves love this
            genre very much and therefore tried to make our site as convenient and
            exciting as possible.
